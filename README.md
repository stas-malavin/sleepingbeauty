A companion data repository to the paper "The Sleeping Beauty: a Parthenogenetic Rotifer Recovered from Arctic Permafrost over 20,000 Years Old"

**Abstract**

We report the unprecedented long-term survival of a microscopic metazoan, an obligate parthenogenetic bdelloid rotifer in the genus Adineta, from relict East-Siberian permafrost (Yedoma formation), radiocarbon-dated to ~24 thousand years before present. By morphological and molecular markers, this ancient Adineta sp. aligns with contemporary A. vaga complex sp. E JFF-2016 isolate Hprim14, collected in Belgium. We have propagated a live culture from single individual and demonstrate that it is capable of surviving slow freezing.
